# Network_Flow_Optimization
 This homework focused on network flow optimization, analyzing network cuts, minimizing flow from source to sink, and maximizing throughput by distributing extra capacities. Students applied maximum flow concepts to resource allocation problems, modeled real-world scenarios like traffic networks, and developed skills to manage flow systems.
