# Network_Flow_Optimization
 This homework focused on network flow optimization, analyzing network cuts, minimizing flow from source to sink, and maximizing throughput by distributing extra capacities. Students applied maximum flow concepts to resource allocation problems, modeled real-world scenarios like traffic networks, and developed skills to manage flow systems.

 In this homework, the goal was to explore network flow optimization by analyzing the capacities of different network cuts and identifying how to minimize feasible flow from the source to the sink.Students worked on distributing extra capacities to maximize throughput and studied how adding new links to a network could impact overall flow efficiency.
Another focus was on solving resource allocation problems using maximum flow concepts, such as finding a perfect matching between people and resources or distributing portions fairly among individuals.The exercises emphasized how mathematical models of flow can be applied to practical scenarios like transportation networks or resource sharing systems.
Students were also introduced to real-world traffic flow modeling by analyzing highway networks, finding shortest paths, and understanding the social costs of delays.
The goal was to develop both theoretical and computational skills in managing flow systems and interpreting their results in real-world contexts.
